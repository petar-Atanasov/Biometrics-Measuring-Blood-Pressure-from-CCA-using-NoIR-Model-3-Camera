# Biometrics-Measuring-Blood-Pressure-from-CCA-using-NoIR-Model-3-Camera
Undergraduate Project, based on Measuaring Blood Pressure from Common Carotid Artery using NoIR Camera for Airport Security System

###
This study examines the application of No Infrared (NoIR) imaging alongside machine
learning to achieve non-invasive artery segmentation for prospective biometric
security purposes. Three segmentation algorithms were investigated utilising picture
data from the common carotid artery (CCA): K-Means clustering, a tailored
Convolutional Autoencoder, and UNet++. The system pipeline comprised
sophisticated preprocessing techniques (Contrast-limited adaptive histogram
equalization (CLAHE), Gaussian filtering, Frangi enhancement) and deep learning
architectures tailored for vascular detection. The performance evaluation integrated
visual inspections, silhouette analysis, and training loss measures, demonstrating that
the UNet++ model exhibits enhanced anatomical correctness and segmentation
quality relative to unsupervised methods. Despite recognised limitations such as
motion artefacts and processing requirements, the results demonstrate the feasibility
of continuous, real-time physiological biometric monitoring, establishing a basis for
future enhancements, including the utilisation of annotated datasets and sophisticated
architectures. This study serves as a crucial advancement towards the implementation
of hybrid health-security biometric applications in high-traffic and security-sensitive
settings such as airports.
